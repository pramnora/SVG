# SVG
SVG/Scalable Vector Graphics program code

SVG, allows the web page user to create both 'still' graphics/as well as, 'moving' animations.

It's possible to use SVG to draw such shapes as...

- lines
- oblongs
- squares
- circles
- ellipses
- polyline
- polygon
- path

In addition to which it's possible to combine together shapes to produce such things as: drawings/or, text messages.

There are 2 main advantages to using SVG code:-

1. SVG graphics code, is all written out as being in the form of text;     
and, therefore, the file sizes can be very 'light weight'...;  
especially, when compared to other graphic file formats;  
which, in turn, means the web page both downloads and runs really 'fast'.   

2. The other most highly noticiable feature of SVG graphics is they can be 'resized' without loosing 'quality';          
which is quite unlike other 'lossy' graphic file formats such as: .jpg/.gif./-etc.;    
in other words, SVG graphics do NOT look pixelated when you either blow them up/or else, shrink them down;    
and, this is because SVG Graphics are calculated mathematically.

EXAMPLE CODES

-----

Circle

The circle has the following properties...

circle cx,cy,r,stroke,stroke-width,fill

cx, horizontal co-ordinate
cy, vertical co-ordinate
r, circle radius
stroke, circle outline colour
stroke-width, circle outline width
fill, circle inside colour

circle cx="50" cy="50" stroke="yellow" stroke-width="4" fill="green"
