# SVG
SVG/Scalable Vector Graphics program code

SVG, allows the web page user to create both 'still' graphics/as well as, 'moving' animations.

It's possible to use SVG to draw such shapes as...

- lines
- oblongs
- squares
- circles
- ellipses

In addition to which it's possible to combine together shapes to produce such things as: drawings/or, text messages.

There are 2 main advantages to using SVG code:-

1. SVG graphics code, is all written out as being in the form of text;     
and, therefore, the file sizes can be very 'light weight'...;  
especially, when compared to other graphic file formats.   

2. Another most noticiable feature of SVG graphics is they can be 'resized' without loosing 'quality';          
which is quite unlike other 'lossy' graphic file formats such as: .jpg/.gif./-etc.;    
in other words, SVG graphics do NOT look pixelated when you either blow them up/or else, shrink them down.
