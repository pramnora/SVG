# SVG
SVG/Scalable Vector Graphics program code

SVG, allows the web page user to create both 'still' graphics/as well as, 'moving' animations.

It's possible to use SVG to draw such shapes as...

- lines
- oblongs
- squares
- circles
- ellipses
- polyline
- polygon
- path

SVG graphics code, is all written out as being in the form of text;   
and, therefore, the file sizes can be very light weight...; when compared to other graphic formats.   

Another most noticiable feature of SVG graphics is they can be 'resized' without loosing quality;      
which is quite unlike other graphic formats such as .jpg/.gif./-etc.;  
in other words, SVG graphics do NOT look pixelated when you either blow them up/or else, shrink them down.
