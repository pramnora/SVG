  Here is the original W3Schools SVG tutorial that my above code was based on.

  <!--what this SVG program displays is...
      A circle...with a line inside...extending out from the middle of the circle;
      together with an ellipse circle at the bottom;
      and, some text saying: 9 PM.

      The idea was to simulate a picture of a 'clock'...
      showing just the hour hand, alone, indicating: 9 PM.-->

  <!--my original heading said...without curly brackets:()...
  (<)svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1"(>)
  ...but, when I went to...
  https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp
  ...their example showed the xmlns=address part can be left out...
  and, replaced with width=""/height="", instead.

   <svg width="200" height="160"style="background:black">

   <circle cx="100" cy="50" r="40" stroke="yellow" stroke-width="5" fill="red" />
   <line x1="100" y1="50" x2="50" y2="50" stroke="orange" stroke-width="5" />

   <!--NOTE(1): This is XML...and, therefore, the end: '/>' is absolutely essential;
                because without this ending tag...shapes go missing...?!-->

   <!--NOTE(2): You have to be really careful where you place co-ordinates;
                because if you go outside of the box/(invisible because background is 'white'); 
                then, the placed item would no longer be visible, anymore...?!-->
